# 🐘 PL/SQL Examples

This repository contains **step-by-step PL/SQL examples** that I created while learning Oracle PL/SQL — starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced topics.  
Each folder covers a specific PL/SQL concept with practical scripts.  

## 📂 Folder Structure & Contents

### 🔹 writing executable statements
Basic PL/SQL block examples using `BEGIN ... END;` structure. Demonstrates how to execute simple SQL statements inside PL/SQL.

### 🔹 writing control structures
Examples of conditional statements (`IF`, `CASE`) and loops (`FOR`, `WHILE`, `LOOP`) for controlling program flow.

### 🔹 defining plsql variables
Covers variable declaration, initialization, scope, and usage of constants, bind variables, and different datatypes.

### 🔹 using sql statements in plsql
Demonstrates how to embed `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements inside PL/SQL blocks.

### 🔹 mixed data types
Examples of using composite datatypes such as records, tables, and %ROWTYPE/%TYPE attributes.

### 🔹 error handling
Shows how to handle errors and exceptions in PL/SQL using `EXCEPTION` blocks, predefined exceptions, and user-defined exceptions.

### 🔹 procedures and functions
Creation of stored procedures and functions, passing parameters (`IN`, `OUT`, `IN OUT`), and reusability of code.

### 🔹 packages
Examples of creating and using packages to group related procedures, functions, and variables under one module.

### 🔹 using oracle packages
Using Oracle’s built-in packages such as `DBMS_OUTPUT`, `DBMS_RANDOM`, `DBMS_SQL`, etc.

### 🔹 using cursors
Demonstrates explicit and implicit cursors for row-by-row processing, cursor attributes, and cursor loops.

### 🔹 trigger creation
Examples of creating row-level and statement-level triggers for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations.

### 🔹 dynamic sql creation
Usage of `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` and `DBMS_SQL` to run dynamic queries at runtime.
